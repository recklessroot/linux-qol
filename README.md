 Simple Quality of Linux Scripts

 Every script here is completely personnalized.
 I am not a dev, i did not write my scripts considering other environments or configurations.

 You won't find any jaw-dropping program here.
 Actually, you won't find any real program here.

 This repository is only the expression of my lazy-self.
 Like making a one-liner into a word

 A probably more detailed explanation of the script should be in the appropriate folder


 Overview:

 mullvad-nomad - Randomly chooses one of the configured country and connect to a mullvad VPN server in that region
 range         - simple number iterator, almost exactly like the python range() function.
